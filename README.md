Spring Boot Product Catalog API

This project is a RESTful API built with Spring Boot, designed to manage a product catalog with CRUD operations for categories and products. It includes:

Categories and Products: Supports a one-to-many relationship where each category can contain multiple products.

CRUD Operations: Allows creating, reading, updating, and deleting categories and products.

Technologies Used:
Spring Boot: REST controllers and annotation-based configuration.
JPA & Hibernate: Entity management and object-relational mapping.
Relational Database: Configured using an RDBMS.
This API serves as a backend solution for managing product catalogs and can be extended or integrated into larger e-commerce systems.
